# Chiro ERP - Consolidated Microservices Architecture

Welcome to the consolidated microservices architecture for Chiro ERP! This project has been restructured from 30+ fine-grained microservices into 8 business-domain-focused multimodal services for better operational efficiency and business alignment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

| **⚙️ operations-service** | Service Operations | `field-service`, `scheduling`, `records`, `repair-rma` | Field service management, resource scheduling, service records | Service Management |
| **🛒 commerce** | Omnichannel Commerce | `ecommerce`, `portal`, `communication`, `pos` | E-commerce, point-of-sale, customer portal, communication hub | Omnichannel Retail |
| **💰 financial-management** | SAP FI Pattern | `general-ledger`, `accounts-payable`, `accounts-receivable`, `asset-accounting`, `tax-engine`, `expense-management` | Complete financial accounting, GL, AP/AR, tax compliance | SAP Financial Accounting (FI) |
| **🏭 supply-chain-manufacturing** | SAP MM/CO Pattern | `production`, `quality`, `inventory`, `product-costing`, `procurement` | Manufacturing execution, quality management, procurement, costing | SAP Materials Management (MM) + Controlling (CO) |
| **🚚 logistics-transportation** | Logistics Management | `fleet`, `tms`, `wms` | Fleet management, transportation planning, warehouse operations | Logistics & Distribution |
| **📊 analytics-intelligence** | Business Intelligence | `data-products`, `ai-ml`, `reporting` | Data analytics, AI/ML models, business intelligence reporting | Enterprise Analytics |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Quarkus 3.17.0 (Supersonic Subatomic Java)
- **Language**: Kotlin with Java 21
- **Architecture**: Hexagonal Architecture with Domain Modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Reactive Panache
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka with Reactive Messaging
- **Monitoring**: Micrometer with Prometheus
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, MockK, Testcontainers

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Gradle 8.0+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Apache Kafka

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chiro-erp
   ```

2. **Start Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres kafka
   ```

3. **Build All Services**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build -s consolidated-settings.gradle.kts
   ```

4. **Run a Service (Development Mode)**
   ```bash
   cd consolidated-services/customer-relationship
   ../../gradlew quarkusDev
   ```

5. **Access Service**
   - API: http://localhost:8080
   - Health: http://localhost:8080/q/health
   - Metrics: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics
   - Dev UI: http://localhost:8080/q/dev

### Service-Specific Commands

Each consolidated service supports these custom Gradle tasks:

```bash
# List all business modules in the service
./gradlew listModules

# Validate module boundaries
./gradlew validateModuleBoundaries

# Generate module documentation
./gradlew generateModuleDocumentation

# Run integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest
```

## 📖 Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Consolidation Plan](microservice-consolidation-plan.md) | Comprehensive consolidation strategy and rationale |
| [Before vs After Comparison](consolidation-comparison.md) | Detailed comparison of architectures |
| [Migration Mapping](service-migration-mapping.md) | Service-to-module migration guide |

## 🏛️ Architecture Principles

### Hexagonal Architecture
Each consolidated service follows hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture:
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, services, and ports
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, and domain services  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Adapters for external systems

### Domain Module Pattern
Original microservices are preserved as domain modules within consolidated services:
- Maintains domain boundaries and business logic
- Enables independent development and testing
- Provides clear migration path from microservices

### Event-Driven Communication
- **Internal**: Direct method calls between modules
- **External**: Asynchronous messaging via Kafka
- **Events**: Domain events for loose coupling

## 🔄 Migration Status

- [ ] Customer Relationship service migration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updates

### 📋 Planned
- [ ] All service migrations
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard updates
- [ ] Team training and handover

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each module tested independently
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on business logic validation

### Integration Testing
- Test module interactions within service
- Use Testcontainers for database/messaging
- Validate API contracts

### End-to-End Testing
- Test critical business workflows
- Cross-service communication validation
- Performance and load testing

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- **Service-level**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Module-level**: Business metrics per domain module
- **Infrastructure**: JVM, database, messaging metrics

### Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Module-specific log levels
- Centralized log aggregation

### Health Checks
- Service health endpoints
- Module-specific health indicators
- Dependency health monitoring

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. Choose a consolidated service to work on
2. Identify the relevant domain module
3. Make changes within module boundaries
4. Run module-specific tests
5. Validate module boundaries
6. Submit pull request

### Code Standards
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Maintain hexagonal architecture principles
- Keep module boundaries clean
- Write comprehensive tests
