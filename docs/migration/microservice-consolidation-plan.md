## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation
1. Create new multimodal service structures
2. Set up shared libraries and components
3. Establish deployment pipelines

### Phase 2: Service-by-Service Migration
1. Start with lowest-risk consolidations
2. Migrate data and APIs incrementally
3. Update inter-service communications

### Phase 3: Optimization and Cleanup
1. Remove redundant infrastructure
2. Optimize performance and monitoring
3. Update documentation and runbooks

## Risk Mitigation
