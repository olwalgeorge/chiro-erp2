# Consolidated Microservices Implementation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines how the 30+ original microservices are implemented within the 8 consolidated multimodal services using **hexagonal architecture** and **domain-driven design** best practices.

## Architecture Pattern

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
Each consolidated service follows hexagonal architecture:

```
Consolidated Service (e.g., core-platform)
├── Domain 1 (e.g., identity)
│   ├── domain/                 # Pure business logic
│   │   ├── models/            # Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates
│   │   ├── services/          # Domain services (business rules)
│   │   └── ports/             # Interfaces (contracts)
│   │       ├── inbound/       # Use cases (application services interface)
│   │       └── outbound/      # Repository, external services interfaces
│   ├── application/           # Use case implementations
│   │   └── XxxService.kt      # Application services
│   ├── infrastructure/        # External adapters (outbound)
│   │   ├── persistence/       # Database adapters
│   │   ├── messaging/         # Event publishing/consuming
│   │   └── external/          # External service clients
│   └── interfaces/            # Inbound adapters
│       ├── rest/              # REST controllers
│       ├── graphql/           # GraphQL resolvers
│       └── events/            # Event listeners
├── Domain 2 (e.g., organization)
│   └── [same structure]
└── shared/                    # Shared utilities within service
    ├── config/
    ├── exceptions/
    └── utils/
```

## Implementation Strategy by Consolidated Service

### 1. **Core Platform Service** - Enterprise Foundation
**Consolidates**: 6 enterprise platform services

**Domains**:
- **security/** - Comprehensive identity, authentication, authorization & security framework
- **organization/** - Tenant management, organizational structure, business units
- **audit/** - Audit trails, compliance monitoring, forensic analysis
- **configuration/** - System configuration, feature flags, environment management
- **notification/** - Multi-channel notifications, escalation workflows
- **integration/** - API gateway, event bus, integration platform

**Key Integration Points**:
- Users belong to Organizations (tenantId)
- Shared authentication context across domains
- Cross-domain events for user-organization sync

### 2. **Customer Relationship Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-crm` + `service-client-management` + `service-provider-management` + `service-subscriptions` + `service-retail-promotions`

**Proposed Structure**:
```
customer-relationship/
├── crm/
│   ├── domain/models/        # Lead, Opportunity, Account
│   ├── domain/ports/
│   ├── application/
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   └── interfaces/
├── client/
│   ├── domain/models/        # Customer, Contact, Relationship
│   └── [same structure]
├── provider/
│   ├── domain/models/        # Vendor, Supplier, Contract
│   └── [same structure]
├── subscription/
│   ├── domain/models/        # Subscription, Plan, Billing
│   └── [same structure]
└── promotion/
    ├── domain/models/        # Campaign, Promotion, Discount
    └── [same structure]
```

### 3. **Operations Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-field-service-management` + `service-resource-scheduling` + `service-records-management` + `service-repair-rma`

**Proposed Structure**:
```
operations-service/
├── field-service/
│   ├── domain/models/        # ServiceOrder, Technician, WorkOrder
│   └── [hexagonal structure]
├── scheduling/
│   ├── domain/models/        # Schedule, Resource, Appointment
│   └── [hexagonal structure]
├── records/
│   ├── domain/models/        # ServiceRecord, Documentation
│   └── [hexagonal structure]
└── repair-rma/
    ├── domain/models/        # RepairOrder, RMA, WarrantyCase
    └── [hexagonal structure]
```

### 4. **E-commerce Experience Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-ecomm-storefront` + `service-customer-portal` + `service-communication-portal`

### 5. **Financial Management Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-billing-invoicing` + `service-ap-automation`

### 6. **Supply Chain Manufacturing Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-mrp-production` + `service-quality-management` + `service-inventory-management`

### 7. **Logistics Transportation Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-fleet-management` + `service-tms` + `service-wms-advanced`

### 8. **Analytics Intelligence Service**
**Consolidates**: `service-analytics-data-products` + `service-ai-ml` + `service-reporting-analytics`

## Domain Integration Patterns

### 1. **Shared Entities**
Some entities are shared across domains within a service:
```kotlin
// Shared between identity and organization domains
data class TenantContext(
    val tenantId: UUID,
    val organizationId: UUID,
    val userId: UUID
)
```

### 2. **Cross-Domain Events**
Domains communicate via domain events:
```kotlin
// Published by identity domain
data class UserCreatedEvent(
    val userId: UUID,
    val tenantId: UUID,
    val username: String
)

// Consumed by organization domain
@EventHandler
suspend fun on(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    // Update organization user count, etc.
}
```

### 3. **Aggregate Boundaries**
Each domain maintains its own aggregates:
- **Identity Domain**: User (aggregate root), Role, Permission
- **Organization Domain**: Organization (aggregate root), Department, Team

### 4. **Cross-Service Communication**
Services communicate via:
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for read operations
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka events for write operations
- **GraphQL**: Federation for complex queries

## Database Strategy

### Option 1: Shared Database per Service
Each consolidated service has one database with domain-specific schemas:
```sql
-- core-platform database
CREATE SCHEMA identity;
CREATE SCHEMA organization;

-- Tables in identity schema
CREATE TABLE identity.users (...);
CREATE TABLE identity.roles (...);

-- Tables in organization schema  
CREATE TABLE organization.organizations (...);
CREATE TABLE organization.departments (...);
```

### Option 2: Database per Domain (Recommended)
Each domain has its own database for better isolation:
```
core-platform-identity-db    # Identity domain data
core-platform-organization-db # Organization domain data
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Modular Monolith**
- Each domain is independently developable
- Clear boundaries between original services
- Easy to extract as separate microservice later

### 2. **Hexagonal Architecture Benefits**
- Business logic isolated from infrastructure
- Easy testing with mock adapters
- Technology-agnostic core domain

### 3. **Domain-Driven Design**
- Original service boundaries preserved as domains
- Rich domain models with behavior
- Ubiquitous language maintained

### 4. **Deployment Simplicity**
- Single deployment per consolidated service
- Reduced operational overhead
- Shared infrastructure and monitoring

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Structure Creation (✅ Complete)
- Created consolidated service structures
- Set up hexagonal architecture skeleton

### Phase 2: Domain Implementation (Current)
- Implement each domain following the pattern above
- Start with core domains (identity, organization)

### Phase 3: Data Migration
- Migrate data from original service databases
- Set up cross-domain referential integrity

### Phase 4: API Migration
- Update client applications to use consolidated APIs
- Implement backward compatibility where needed

### Phase 5: Event-Driven Integration
- Set up Kafka topics for cross-service communication
- Implement event sourcing for audit requirements

This approach maintains the business logic integrity of your original 30+ services while providing the operational benefits of consolidated deployment and shared infrastructure.
